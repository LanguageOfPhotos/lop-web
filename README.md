LOP Web Application

You do not have to speak or know any language.
Just sign up, and the pictures are your language.
Open source image library for speak to people.

For the country of your choice, you can choose one of the existing categories and upload images that you think are universal.

Situation example; 
Category with various filters, such as country. By using these filters, you can see all the data you need by glancing at all the data. For example, you went to China, but you do not speak chinese. You will have your specific needs. For example 
- Hotel, 
- Public transportation, 
- Airport, 
- Restaurant where you can eat, 
- Such as free wifi. 

You will not be able to tell them because you do not know them in chinese. But your opponent will understand that when you show the letter H, which is a universal symbol, for the hotels. Or when you show the wifi logo, when you show a picture with a spoon fork, you will know that you are looking for a restaurant or free wifi spot. Thats it. Some filters here will make our work easier.
- Country, (China, Turkey, United States of America, France, Czech Republic etc..)
- Category,
